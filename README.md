# vectorboi *(s)*

Real-Time genetic algorithm involving agents called vectorbois!

A vectorboi is a pixel with an assortment of 2d vectors called "kicks". Every so often, a subsequent kick is applied to the vectorboi, which consequently applies an impulse to the organism. Vectorbois who are closer to or are touching the goat receives a higher fitness then ones that are farther away or dead. After a generation is finished, the population is evaluated by a genetic algorithm and the fittest organism is selected.
